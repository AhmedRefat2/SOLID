# 🚀 SOLID Principles – Clean Code Demonstrations
### Practical Console-Based Application for SOLID Explaination

This repository demonstrates the SOLID principles using structured 
C# console examples. Each principle includes both a violating 
implementation and a corrected version to help developers 
understand real-world design improvements.

## 📌 What is SOLID?
SOLID is a set of five object-oriented design principles 
that improve maintainability, scalability, readability, flexibility 
and testability in software systems.

## 🔹 SOLID Principles — Ultra Summary
    1. S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    One class → one responsibility → one reason to change.
    
    2. O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
    Extend behavior without modifying existing code.
    
    3. L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    Subclasses must behave correctly when used as their base type.
    
    4. I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    Prefer small, specific interfaces over large, general ones.
    
    5. D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

## 📁 Inside Each Principle Folder
    🔴 Violate/ → Example demonstrating incorrect design
    🟢 Apply/ → Refactored example applying the principle correctly

## 🎯 Why This Repository?
Many developers understand SOLID theoretically, but struggle to:

    - Recognize violations in real projects
    - Refactor code properly
    - Apply principles in clean architecture

This repository focuses on:
    - Simple console-based examples
    - Clear before/after comparisons
    - Realistic but easy-to-understand scenarios

## 🛠 Technologies Used
    - C#
    - NET Console Application
    - Object-Oriented Programming concepts

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-AhmedRefat2/SOLID.git

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.

3. Navigate to any principle folder.

4. See both:
    - The Violate version
    - The Apply version

5. Compare the structure and design differences.

## 🧠 Learning Goal

After studying this repository, you should be able to:
    
    - Identify SOLID violations in code
    - Refactor code using proper design principles
    - Improve code maintainability and flexibility
    - Think in abstractions instead of implementations

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Improve examples

    - Add new scenarios
    - Refactor with advanced patterns
    - Add unit testing examples
    - Feel free to fork and submit a pull request.
